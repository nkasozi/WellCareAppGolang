# Reconciler

Reconciliation as a service to assist financial auditors reconcilers inspectors accountants and superiors

The main objective of the project is to design, develop and deploy a cloud based automated financial reconciliation solution that comprises a Progressive Web Application (PWA) and desktop app as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This solution should enable any business to enjoy all the advantages of reconciliation without any of the headache felt if you were to do it manually

## Requirements

The platform will be developed as a [progressive web application (PWA)](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) for the end-user. A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser such as Chrome, Firefox, etc. 

Functionality includes [working offline](https://www.simicart.com/blog/pwa-offline/), [push notifications](https://www.pushpro.io/blog/pwa-push-notifications-for-progressive-web-apps), and [device hardware access](https://www.simicart.com/blog/pwa-hardware-access/), enabling the creation of native user experiences on desktop and mobile devices. A progressive web app eliminates the requirement for developers or users to install web apps via digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play. The PWA can be added to the home screen as an application icon for users to easily access and re-access the PWA. This will increase market footprint with minimal effort and seamless Search Engine Optimization
